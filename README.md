# roslaunch-catch_and-_catch-catch_and_catch.launch

This is a fun implementation of Catch and Catch game done using ROS Turtlesim.

Initially a turtle will be there which is the catcher of the game. A new turtle will be spawned to which the catcher will go to the goal position to catch it. Everytime we catch a turtle a new turtle is spawned in a random position. This process repeats continuously.

  <p>
  <li><h5>Locating random positions<h5></li>
    > random.randrange() <br>
    This function can output a random value between the range of value we give it as a input. So by using this we can locate and spawn a turtle in random positions of the turtlesim workspace.</p>
    <p>
    <li><h5>Spawning new turtle</h5></li>
    >Turtle_spawn(goal,killer_name,spawn_name)<br>
    By using this function we can create a new turtle anywhere in the screen according to our inputs. The inputs are <br>
    goal = position<br>
    killer_name and spawn_name <br>
    So the turtle will be spawned at the goal position with the name of spawn_name
    </p>
    <p>
    <li><h5>Identifying Distance</h5></li>
      The distance between the spawned turtle and the catcher turtle is found using the function <br>
      >euclidean_distance(self, goal_pose)
    </p>
    <p>
      <li><h5>Equating the distance</h5></li>
      Equating the distance between the turtles with the tolerance level, the linear and angular velocities of the turtle is changed simultaneously<br>
      >while self.euclidean_distance(goal_pose) >= float(distance_tolerance):<br>
      With that the turtle moves for catching the new turtles<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <li><h5>Killing the turtle</h5></li>
      >Turtle_kill(killer_name)<br>
      This function is used to kill the turtle whose input parameter is the name of the turtle. Once the catcher turtle catches the newly spawned turtle, then the <b>Turtle_Kill</b> function is been called<br>
      >self.Turtle_kill('turtle2')
    </p>

</ol>
